# Roccat Vulcan API
With this Node Module you can control your Roccat Vulcan Keyboard. Bring your keyboard to life!  

## Demo / Video
This module was developed for an interactive data visualisation. Have a look:

## Installation
Install per npm  
`npm install roccatvulcan`  
or clone repository  
`git clone git@github.com:simonhuwiler/roccatvulcan.git`

## Usage
**Important**: Close your Roccat Swarm App (right click -> close)
```javascript
//Load module
const RoccatVulcan = require('roccatvulcan');

//Init Keyboard
keyboard = new RoccatVulcan({
  layout: 'ch-de',
  ready: () => {
    console.log("Keyboard is ready!");

    //Set every key to yellow
    keyboard.fillAll('#ffcc00');

    //Send new colors to keyboard
    keyboard.render();
  }
});
```

## Init Parameters
`productId` (optional)  
The Api will search automaticly for your keyboard. Although it may be possible, that your keyboard version is unknown. Then you need to provide a productId. If the keyboard is not found, you will see all possible devices in your terminal. Copy the Id of the corresponding one.

`layout`  
The keyboard layout. Supported layouts:  
  * `ch-de` for Swiss
  * `de-de` for Germany (thanks to Erik!)
  
Add your own support by duplicating and editing the folder `keyboardlayout/ch-de`!

`ready` (optional)  
Callback after keyboard is initialised.

`onData` (optional) 
Callback when key pressed

## Render-Methods
When ever you change the colors of a key, the api will store every key in the memory. The api will not send the new colors to the keyboard by itself, you need to **render** the current state. Two methods will help you:
### Single rendering
```javascript
keyboard.render()
```
This will send all the current colors to the keyboard
### Auto rendering
```javascript
keyboard.renderStart(50);
```
This will start continous rendering every 50 millisecond.  
  
```javascript
keyboard.renderStop();
```
Stops the auto renderer.

## Coloring-Methods
**Fill all**
```javascript
fillAll(color)
```
Will colorize each key. **Be aware**: Only hex-colors are supported. No `blue` or `black`.  
```javascript
// Example
keyboard.fillAll('#ffcc00');
```

**Update Keys**
```javascript
updateKeys(keys, color[, backgroundColor])
```
Will only update the given keys, all other keys will remain the same. Except: `backgroundColor` is given!  
Params:
* `keys`: List of Keys
* `color`: New color in hex
* `backgroundColor`: optional. Changes the color of all other keys  


```javascript
// Example
keyboard.updateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S' ,'D'], '#ff0000')
```
**Update Key**
```javascript
updateKey(key, colors[, backgroundColor])
```
Same as `updateKeys` but takes only one key.
```javascript
// Example
keyboard.updateKey('W', '#ff0000')
```

**Animate Keys**  
```javascript
animateKeys(keys, colorFrom, colorTo, duration)
```
Creates a transition between two colors. Be aware: Auto Rendering needs to be running!  
Params:
* `keys`: List of Keys to animate
* `colorFrom`: Start color
* `colorTo`: End Color
* `duration`: Duration in Miliseconds

```javascript
// Example
keyboard.animateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S', 'D'], '#000000', '#ff0000', 1000);
```

**Animate Key**
```javascript
animateKey(key, colorFrom, colorTo, duration)
```
Same as above with single key
```javascript
// Example
keyboard.animateKeys('W', '#000000', '#ff0000', 1000);
```

**Write Text (Experimental!)**
```javascript
write(text, color, keyOffset)`
```
Writes given Text on the keyboard. **Only a few keys are currently supported! Have a look at** 
[keyboardlayout/ch-de/alphabet.js](./src/keyboardlayout/ch-de/alphabet.js)  
```javascript
// Example
keyboard.write("ANNA", '#ff0000', 20)
```

**Marquee (Experimental!)**
```javascript
marquee(text, color, speed)
```

Writes text the same way as `write` but let the text scroll over the keyboard. Like the old HTML-Tag `marquee`. **Only a few keys are currently supported! Have a look at** [keyboardlayout/ch-de/alphabet.js](./src/keyboardlayout/ch-de/alphabet.js)
```javascript
// Example
keyboard.marquee("ANNA", '#ff0000', 200);
```

## AnimationQueue
You can queue animations and run them at will. Use the AnimationQueue for that purpose.  

### Add Animation to Queue
```javascript
keyboard.animationQueueAdd(animation, timeout);
```
Params:
* `animation`: Function which will be triggered.
* `timeout`: After how many milliseconds **after the last animation** this animation should be triggered

### Start Animation Queue
```javascript
keyboard.animationQueueStart(onFinish)
```
Starts the Animation Queue and will trigger `onFinish` after all animations have finished

### Stop and Clear Animation Queue
```javascript
keyboard.animationQueueStop()
```

### Example
This will change the colors of the Keys AWSD.
```javascript
keyboard.animationQueueAdd(() => this.keyboard.animateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S', 'D'], '#000000', '#ffcc00', 2000), 0);
keyboard.animationQueueAdd(() => this.keyboard.animateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S', 'D'], '#ffcc00', '#3224ee', 2000), 2000);
keyboard.animationQueueAdd(() => this.keyboard.animateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S', 'D'], '#3224ee', '#d324ee', 2000), 2000);
keyboard.animationQueueAdd(() => this.keyboard.animateKeys(['W', 'A', 'S', 'D'], '#d324ee', '#55bc18', 2000), 2000);
keyboard.animationQueueStart();
```

## Get Key Pressed event
To get the key press event, you can bind an event to the `onData` option on initialisation:
```javascript
//Init Keyboard
keyboard = new RoccatVulcan({
  productId: 12440,
  layout: 'ch-de',
  onData: data => {
    console.log("Key", data.key);
    console.log("State", data.state);
  }
});
```
The data parameter is an object with two states:
* `key`: The key pressed
* `state`: The state: 1 = pressed, 0 = released


## Turn of a Key
To turn of a key, you need to send the color (#000000) black to the keyboard.
```javascript
keyboard.fillAll('#000000');
```

## Grid
Sometimes you want to access your key by its position on the keyboard, instead of its value. Use the `grid` where each key is in a cell.  
```javascript
var grid = keyboard.getGrid();
```  
Returns a multi array. Have a look at the file [src/keyboardlayout/ch-de/grid.js](./src/keyboardlayout/ch-de/grid.js)  

To change the color of the first row (`ESC, F1, F2`...) use it this way:  
```javascript
var grid = keyboard.getGrid();
keyboard.animateKeys(grid[0], '#000000', '#ff0000', 1000)
```
